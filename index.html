<p>Worked with team of consultants to support the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on their document management system.  The system was comprised of Stellent IBPM and custom .NET web applications, web services, windows services, and windows applications.

Architect and Build Document Import application (web application, windows services, msmq)
ASP.NET application allows users to authenticate with active directory.  Input and authenticate case information with 2 associated systems (web services) and then attach and upload electronic documents about the case
Documents are routed into the doc mgmt system using MSMQ and 2 .NET Windows services.  The services where multi-threaded and moved messages pertaining to import jobs from a conversion queue to an import queue.  Conversion service normalized the documents to tiff and dropped the message into the import queue.  The import service injected the data and images into the COTS system.
The message queues and back end services were later used to route case documents into the system from alternate sources and proved to be a more reliable and scalable solution than the vendors path.</p>
